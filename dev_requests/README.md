Dev Requests
===============

Place JSON request files here following `dev_request_schema.json` at the repository root.

Usage
- Create one JSON file per request. Example filenames: `0001-add-contributing.json`, `0002-fix-typo.json`.
- When you're ready for me to act, paste the JSON into the chat and include `"execute": true` OR tell me the filename and ask me to run it.

Guidelines
- Do not include secrets or tokens in the JSON.
- Prefer `patch` for multi-file edits (use the V4A diff format the assistant accepts).
- Keep requests small and focused when possible.

Examples in this folder show typical request shapes. They are not executed automatically.
